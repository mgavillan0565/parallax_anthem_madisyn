	<h2>We, Never I</h2>
	<p>
	To think differently than your brothers is the biggest sin imaginable. "WE ARE ONE IN ALL AND ALL IN ONE. THERE ARE NO MEN BUT ONLY THE GREAT WE, ONE, INDIVISIBLE AND FOREVER."(Rand) Our destiny is chosen for us. We live in a society of syncretism. This is the only way. If we think differently we shall be sent to the Palace of Corrective Detention, where the Council will determine our fate. Unlike our brothers we, Equality 7-2521 are strange. At 6 feet tall, we have been told that there is evil in our bones. We used to live together with our brothers in the home of the students. During our time in the home of students we caught on easily, learning faster than our brothers. This is a result of our great curse, for this we were lashed. But in the present, We are a street sweeper. We will comply and complete the duty that the council of vocations has given to us. </p>

	<h2>We are Curious</h2>
	<p>
	We have a friend. Their name is International 4-8818. This is one of the biggest transgressions that one can make. The transgression of preference is one that we live with daily. When we escape from a long day of work, we escape to our special, private place. We know this is wrong but our curiosity is too much to bare. Down in this mysterious tunnel we discover things that could've only been made in the unmentionable times. During these times people used horseless wagons and had wasteful tendencies. These times were abolished when men began to realize the great truth "that all men are one and that there is no will save the will of all men together." (Rand) We have discovered a great invention. A lightbulb that can provide light without fire. We must present this to the council. They will commend us for our work and we will be rewarded!

  <h2>Our Enlightenment</h2>
	<p>
	We have been enlightened, this society is not just. The main goal of the council is to limit all creativity. After being jailed and beaten for our findings we must leave this place and take all of our findings with us. We escape into the Uncharted Forest. We know there won't be anyone there. For it is a great sin to even think of such a place. A place where one is separated from their brothers and subjected to the remnants of the unspeakable times. We run, we run far far away from our old home, leaving behind everything we've ever known. We come across a strange structure, it seems to be a living space for those who lived in the unspeakable times. When we enter we are bombarded by knowledge, books, pictures, and new words.

	<h2>Now I can see</h2>
	<p>
	I know undertsand what mankind is missing. I have always been condemned for the "sins" that I was born with. The desire to be my own person, to see the world differently. I wept in sadness for the people I once knew who will never understand the beauty of this word. "I am done with the monster of “We,” the word of serfdom, of plunder, of misery, falsehood and shame. And now I see the face of god, and I raise this god over the earth, this god whom men have sought since men came into being, this god who will grant them joy and peace and pride. This god, this one word:“I.”" (Rand)
